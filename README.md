# LED-Cube
This is a personal project I made alone which is an LED cube with RGB LED matrixes on 4 sides, which can be programmed in any way

## Hardware
The hardware consists of an arduino nano, and 4 16x16 RGB LED matrixes  

## Software
To design the box, I used Fusion 360  
To program the arduino I used VSCode with the PlatformIO plugin in C++  

## 3D Design
To make my design easily printable, and to reduce the amount of wasted filament when prints inevitably had oversights I made the design consist of a base, 4 walls, and a roof. The walls friction fit into the base, and the LED matrix sandwiches between the wall and the matrix's front cover. The front covers insert into the walls with 3D printed pegs. I went for this design because I didn't want there to be visible screws in the white cover
